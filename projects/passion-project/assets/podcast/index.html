        <h1>Transcript</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my passion podcast. Hello, my name is Rio. In today’s episode, I’m going to be talking about my passion, coding. I’m going to talk about the all the things about coding.</p>
        <p>Let’s start with my story about computers. It started when I made my first website on Google Sites about a year ago. Google Sites is a platform that offers website designs without coding. It is commonly used by people who don’t know how to code a website but need to make a website quickly. However, it had an embed option that people could paste in HTML code. Soon, I learned that, with HTML and CSS, I could add custom and flexible elements to my site. I started looking up tutorials on the internet. I made many designs such as card designs and button designs that made my site better.A few months later, I started coding on GitHub for even more flexible and custom designs. I didn’t have to make an iFrame to insert HTML code.</p>
        <p>Next is the history of coding. Coding languages were first developed in the 1950s. However, they were never fully implemented. Back then, computers never existed. Some languages created in this era are Short Code, FLOW-MATIC, Auto-code, and LISP. As time passed, many languages were created but never became popular. In the 1980s, this started to change. The first computers were introduced, and many languages came with them. C++, a still popular coding language today, was introduced in 1983. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee introduced the web or HTML. In the 2000s, many languages popular today were developed. </p>
        <p>One career related to coding is a software developer. Software developers develop applications to meet the user client’s needs. They typically meet up and talk about what application the user needs to be developed. Another career is a mobile app developer. Unlike software developers, they do not make applications for a specific user. They develop apps for many users to experience it and make revenue from it. The third career is a full-stack web developer. This is the most common career when it comes to coding. They develop websites to make the web better. This may include coding in client-side languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or server-side languages such as PHP and Python. Last but not least, the fourth career is a network administrator. Almost every company relies on network administrators to help fix network problems. This job also includes managing network access to people.</p>
        <p>Coding has many ways that relate to school. First of all, it is a passion that connects directly to careers. Coding has been a fast-growing area of careers in the past few years. The demand has been high as well. As I said, there are many careers that can come from coding. Schools teach students how to prepare to be an adult and have a career. Unlike sports, coding can directly connect to careers. Second of all, coding teaches critical thinking and problem-solving skills. A great example of this is debugging. Debugging is the process of finding code that is not working in a file or folder and fixing it. This helps students develop a brain that can handle extreme problems that require high concentration. </p>
        <p>Some people I admire are Tim Berners Lee, the founder of the world wide web, and Asaf Darash, the founder of Regpack, an amazing online registration service. In Asaf Darash’s interview, he says he is “still passionate about my day to day work: Coding!” In the interview, Asaf Darash explains that coding “touches every single person in the organization and makes a difference to every single user that touches it.” He also explains that he “[loves] to code because if I can think it, [he] can make it a reality.”</p>
        <p>Thanks for joining me in today’s episode of my passion. See ya later!</p>
